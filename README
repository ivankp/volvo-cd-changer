Melbus CDCHGR Emulator
Program that emulates the MELBUS communication from a CD-changer (CD-CHGR) in a Volvo V70 (HU-xxxx) to enable AUX-input through the 8-pin DIN-contact. 
This setup is using an Arduino Nano 5v clone

The HU enables the CD-CHGR in its source-menue after a successful initialization procedure is accomplished. 
The HU will remove the CD-CHGR everytime the car starts if it wont get an response from CD-CHGR (second init-procedure).
